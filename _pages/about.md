Welcome to the **Plant Breeding & Genetics Research Laboratory**! 

We are dedicated to advancing agricultural science through innovative research on **agronomic, forage, and horticultural crops**. By combining traditional breeding with cutting-edge molecular technologies, we aim to maximize both the quantitative and qualitative yield of crops. Our goal is to help them thrive in a changing climate and boost farmer productivity.

Through our work, we are committed to building a more resilient and sustainable crop system for everyone.
