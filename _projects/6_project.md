Evaluated wheat germplasms for growth, water use, and water use efficiency under drought stress using physiological and molecular techniques. Identified wheat genotypes with improved water potential in a low moisture environment of the Pacific Northwest regions and mapped molecular markers associated with water use trait. 

This research was funded through Washington Wheat Commission, Goldsworthy Wheat Research Fund, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project, and a Monsanto Beachell Borlaug fellowship.
