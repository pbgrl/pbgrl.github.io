Evaluated switchgrass germplasms in multiple locations and years for biomass yield, ethanol yield, and nutritional compositions. Developed switchgrass genotypes with high biomass yield potential with the suitability to grow as bioenergy and forage crops in marginal environments and identified genomic regions associated with these traits.
